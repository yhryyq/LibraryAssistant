Installation & Configuration:
Link to repository: https://github.com/yhryyq/LibraryAssistant
The Librarian Assistant is designed to be used exclusively as a PC app. A PC with Windows system is therefore required. Some manual work is needed - customers will need to import their book and user’s information into a SQL database in the format that Librarian Assistant expects.

Usage for different types of users
Registered Users
Search
As a registered user you can search books on LibraryAssistant.
Borrow/ Return books
Users can borrow the book they want after searching it. After reading, users can also return the book. In the book return interface, the user can see how many days that the user can hold the book.
Logout
The user can log out by turning off the software directly.
Set Reminder
Users can set the method of reminders return by themselves, e-mail or SMS.

Librarians
Librarians can borrow and return books like ordinary users. Administrators have more functions of managing books than ordinary users. 
Add books from the Library
When the librarian logs in the management interface, he can add new books. After inputting the information of all the books, you can add a book successfully. 
Remove books from the Library 
When the librarian logs in the management interface, he can see a list of books. He can delete one or more books in the list. 
Misc notes
● Currently, librarians can only be authorized by database admins.
●By default, this software serves the school, so it is assumed that both user and administrator information are from the free database of the school.
● Some use case functionalities such as messaging, examine and verify book return
and more detail will be implemented in the next iteration.
